# Calendar of life

How often do you think about your life? That’s the question, legendary writer, Tim Urban proposed on a blog post, titled “Your Life in Weeks" back in 2014.

He showed variations of a calendar not from the perspective of a year, but an entire lifetime.

To cite Carl Sagan, every king and peasant, hero and villain, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every corrupt politician, every supreme leader, saint and sinner all lived their lives within the confines of a life calendar.

My Life Calendar it's web-project where anyone can see his life and think about it.
